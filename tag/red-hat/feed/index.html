					<description><![CDATA[<p>The recent high-profile “Meltdown” and “Spectre” security event did more than expose newly-discovered problems in processor architectures dating back decades. It also exposed gaps in the Security Lifecycle Program for many organizations, possibly even in your own.</p>
<p>The details of this security event are already well-documented (see the original security notification in Red Hat’s Portal or this 3-minute video providing a high-level overview). So, what can your IT organization do to be better prepared for the next security event? Here are four practical actions you can take now to improve your Security Lifecycle Program.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the completion of a <a href="http://forsetti.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/redhatjobs-today-was-my-first-day-and-i-cant-wait-to-go-back-tomorrow/">full year at Red Hat</a>.  It has been an incredible year!  I find myself positively challenged daily, working with some of the smartest people I have ever met &#8212; both my colleagues within Red Hat, and the customers I get to work with.  I get the privilege of being able to work with Open Source technologies, and bring them to a great variety of enterprises.  And I have even found my niche within Red Hat&#8217;s Identity Management space (imagine that!).</p>
<p>I do miss my team and other <a href="http://forsetti.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/its-so-hard-to-say-goodbye-to-yesterday/">friends at UConn</a>.  UConn gave me great opportunity, both to gain strong technical skills, and to experience leadership, both formally as management, and informally as a mentor and vocal innovator.  I place great value in those first 13 years of my professional career, and I look forward to achieving similar gains in my next 13 years!</p>

<p>Straightforward advice &#8212; plan, plan, plan, then do.</p>
<p>Qualcomm reduced hardware deployment significantly and simplified management with the RHEV tool suite &#8212; significant operational savings.</p>
<p>Qualcomm made extensive use of the virt-v2v tool, but had to modify it (yay Open Source!) to make it cluster (RHCS) aware.  Modifications are shipping with RHEV 6.3.</p>
