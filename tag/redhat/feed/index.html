										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years at Red Hat have flown by at such a rapid pace; I&#8217;m even a couple months late in blogging about it!  To top off another year full of great projects, awesome technology, and incredible people, I&#8217;ve had a couple exciting things happen that I wanted to share.</p>
<p>Last month I was chosen to be a &#8220;Red Hat Chairman&#8217;s Award&#8221; recipient, and last week (photo below) I was awarded &#8220;North American Account Solutions Architect&#8221; of the Year!</p>

<p>I am truly humbled by both of these awards, and was speechless when I heard my name called (those who know me well understand how rare that is). I am looking forward to see what this next year will bring!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So yet again, this blog post comes as I sit in the RDU airport, leaving behind sunny blue skies and ~50 degree temperatures to arrive just before midnight in cold, wet snow. &#8212; it is good to get home!  I&#8217;ve been in Raleigh again for a couple days, this time for Red Hat IdM (Identity Management( training, and Value Selling training.  Both were great sessions &#8212; of course I enjoy good technical sessions, but I learned quite a bit from the Sales class too.  It really opened my eyes to a few bad habits, which I can now work to address.<br />
<a href="http://forsetti.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wpid-20130307_1809281.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="20130307_180928.jpg" class="alignright size-full" alt="image" src="http://forsetti.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/wpid-20130307_1809281.jpg" /></a> </p>
<p><a href="https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html-single/Identity_Management_Guide/index.html">Red Hat&#8217;s IdM</a> is pretty cool &#8212; I wish I had know more about it sooner.  It comes with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and provides a unified LDAP, Kerberos, DNS, and CA solution.  Plus, when used in combination with SSSD, you get a nicely managed user/group/policy solution consistent across your RHEL servers and desktops (and to a lesser extent, other *nix systems that support Kerberos and LDAP).  I have been a longtime proponent of OpenLDAP and MIT Kerberos, and still believe they are each very powerful solutions &#8212; but Red Hat&#8217;s IdM is a very cohesive suite that ties multiple functions and technologies together <strong>very</strong> well.</p>
<p>Now to really get down to studying for the upcoming RHCE exam &#8212; wish me luck!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t get into New York City too often, but I had the opportunity this week to check out Red Hat&#8217;s office.  I took the Amtrak in and out of Penn Station, and a quick subway hop to the office.  Just a stone&#8217;s throw from Wall St, Red Hat is waaaay up on the 24th floor.  I got to meet most of the SA team for the NE region, and we headed over to Suspenders for dinner, follow by drinks at the Pegu Club, and just had a real good time talking for several hours.</p>
<p>What a smart, active bunch &#8212; it is awesome ( but still a bit intimidating ) to be part of this!</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;I love it here!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This is an awesome place!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m where I want to be!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an excitement here, people working towards common goals, within a common set of philosophies, understanding how they each contribute to the successes of the company.  The work is interesting, challenging, even enjoyable, and the goals are admirable.</p>
<p>Every session at orientation ended with the presenter saying &#8220;Welcome to Red Hat!&#8221; &#8212; and I believe they mean it!</p>
<p>I am incredibly excited to be on board &#8211; what a great place to be!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discussion about OpenShift.  OpenShift has been fully open-sourced, available on <a href="http://github.com/openshift">GitHub</a> for local deployment, or directly usable as a hosted <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">solution</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #1: IaaS != PaaS</strong></p>
<p>Virtual machines : Application is not necessarily 1:1</p>
<p><strong>Rule #2: PaaS is not a silver bullet</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Great for Self-service deployment of applications, varied volatile workloads (development, testing, scale-up/out), with tightly constrained application rules &#8212; which implies standardized deployments from template.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #3: PaaS is about developers &#8212; AND OPERATIONS!!!!</strong></p>
<p>Operations becomes about capacity planning, not ticket-drive activities.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #4: Be ready to learn</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Developers want languages variety, scaling models, integration models &#8212; and they want it automagically</p>
<p>Operations want multi-tenancy, familiar installation, and sane configurations &#8212; all reproducible.</p>
<p><strong>What is an application?</strong></p>
<p>Runtime (OpenShift cartridges)</p>
<p>Code (One Git repository per application)</p>
<p><strong>Creating an App</strong></p>
<p>The rhc tools are used to create a namespace (domain), then an application space which includes a name and cartridge type, and push the code.</p>
<p><strong>What do you get from public OpenShift?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A slice of the server, a private Git repository, deployment access.</p>
<p>The PaaS service is comprised of a Broker (director front-end, RESTful) and Nodes.  Each node has multiple &#8220;gears&#8221; (containers secured with SELinux, constrained with cgroups, and isolated with Kernel namespaces and Bind Mounts).</p>
<p><strong>Extending OpenShift</strong></p>
<p>Custom DNS plugins, auth plugs, security policies, and community cartridges.  Quick-start frameworks can be offered to community too.</p>
<p><strong>LXC and SELinux are the future for isolating and securing OpenShift&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8230; but right now, there are a many moving parts being used to provide isolation and security.</p>
<p><strong>PaaS demans a new security model</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>DAC just won&#8217;t cut-it, too complicated for PaaS.  MAC (SELinux!) is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Unlearn this (and embrace SELinux)!</strong></p>
<pre>setenforce 0</pre>
<p><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Learn the &#8216;Z&#8217; (to see SELinux contexts)</strong></p>
<pre>ls -lZ
ps -efZ</pre>
<p><strong>(Review of SELinux contexts and syntax provided)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux</a></p>
<p><strong>Demo &#8211; deployment of WordPress to OpenShift, in a VirtualBox LiveCD</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Red Hat has several options for storage needs &#8212; GFS2, CIFS, (p)NFS, Gluster.  It&#8217;s all about right tool for the job.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/index.html#103">http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/index.html#103</a></p>
<h1>RHEL Resilient Storage &#8211; GFS2</h1>
<p>Shared storage, scales up to 100TB per instance, supports 2-16 nodes in the cluster, x86_64 only.</p>
<p>Performance is directly related to server and storage class, and to access sets &#8212; best case is where each node generally access its own filesystem area, worst case is where nodes are fighting for locks of the same files/directories.</p>
<h1>RHEL NFS Client</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s an NFS client &#8212; what else needs to be said?</p>
<h1>pNFS</h1>
<p>Metadata server tells you where to go to get your data, and can even reference data across multiple-tiers &#8212; NFS or directly to the SAN.</p>
<p>Performance can be enhanced with large write caches, internally tiered storage, and is suitable for most workloads, even transactional DBs (using O_DIRECT).  Not so good for highly random read workloads.</p>
<h1>Red Hat Storage (Gluster + utilities, support, and blueprint)</h1>
<p>RHS is a standalone product.  RHS servers in supported config are RAID6+local storage, XFS filesystems, dedicated RHEL6.x and Gluster software, all deployed on commodity hardware (reducing cost).</p>
<p>Clients use Gluster for scalability; NFS or CIFS for simplicity.</p>
<p>Performance improved by scaling horizontally across servers.  But, there is no write cache, and Gluster is a user=space filesystem with some overhead from context switching.  Likely not suitable for big I/O (databases, mail servers), but great for big unstructured data.</p>
<p>Scales to 6PB (or 3PB mirrored), and can add capacity dynamically.</p>
<h1></h1>

<p>But &#8212; this ain&#8217;t your grandma&#8217;s chmod.  There is some significant complexity.  But, depending in your risk model, it may very well be worth it.</p>
<p>Note &#8212; check out the sandbox util (policycoreutils-python) with the X capabilities (policycoreutils-sandbox).  Provides a great tool for running individual processes under extremely tight lock-down.</p>
