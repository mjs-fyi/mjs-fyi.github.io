										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just posted the first (and likely only) <a href="https://github.com/forsetti/qif-util">release of qif-util</a> .</p>
<p>qif-utils is a very small set of small tools to manipulate QIF files, written sloppily in a very small amount of time.</p>
<p>Having used <a href="http://gnucash.org">Gnucash</a> very happily for a decade, I&#8217;ve always been irritated by the manual method I needed to perform to map transactions to accounts.  <a href="https://github.com/forsetti/qif-util">qif-util</a> was written to automate some of that process, and has been posted in case anyone else can benefit from it.  However, do not rely on this code for anything significant &#8212; only about 20 hours was put into development, most being spent tweaking the output process to give me something usable.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/forsetti/qif-util">qif-util</a> currently provides 3 command line tools, written in Python &#8211; see the <a href="https://github.com/forsetti/qif-util/blob/master/README">README</a> for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>qif-augment inserts account name and type, and an initial transaction representing the opening balance of an account</li>
<li>qif-csv converts a QIF file into CSV (with columns hardcoded into the code)</li>
<li>qif-rules accepts a file of rules describing how to assign a category (&#8220;L&#8221; QIF code) to QIF transactions, based on matching fields in the transaction.  See the <a href="https://github.com/forsetti/qif-util/blob/master/doc/test.rules">sample rules file</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why post such a trivial and unsupported set of tools?  Well, we are entering tax season in the U.S., QIF is still the most common financial export format out there, and I work for the <a href="http://redhat.com">best open source company</a> out there and fully believe in sharing with the community.  So, if you find value out of these, please drop me a comment here.</p>
