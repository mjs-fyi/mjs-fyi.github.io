I hear that. Oracle must be a little shaky after the OpenOffice project broke off. I don&#039;t know the exact details, but it sounded to me like the decision was not Oracle&#039;s to make.

I&#039;m with James Gosling all the way:

I think it is pretty clear that Oracle does not have the faintest clue how to do open source business. I don&#039;t know the steps that need to be taken in order to &quot;liberate&quot; Java, but I&#039;ll be sure to have its back as soon as I see the wheels are in motion.

/ And hey, thanks for not taking offense of my little self-advertisement up there =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/09/where-is-java-going/#comment-2&quot;&gt;Erlend&lt;/a&gt;.

I do believe that there is a lot of power in Java the language, and Java the platform.  While generally the overhead of the JVM is insignificant, the area of high-performance 3D rendering is the exception.  If you can beat this, then you&#039;ve got a great product.

But, the future of Java the product ... well, Oracle scares the hell out of me.  I can only hope that &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; successfully reproduces the entire Java platform in a way that violates no patents, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaffe.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;names it&lt;/a&gt; something else to avoid copyright issues, and garners significant &lt;a href=&quot;http://apache.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;community support&lt;/a&gt; to become the driving force behind ongoing development.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How about in the direction of games? ;)

I&#039;m with the team behind jMonkeyEngine, a 3D game development suite. So prepare for a shameless plug.

We recently nominated for Packt&#039;s Open Source Awards under the &quot;Graphics Software&quot; category. A top placement could really mean a lot to us, as we feel like there are a lot of talented Java developers who would be very happy to know about us, but we just don&#039;t have the funds to actively advertise ourselves.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could lend a hand in spreading the word. If you&#039;d rather not approve this comment I&#039;ll not take offense.

Sincerely,

~ Erlend Sogge Heggen]]></description>
