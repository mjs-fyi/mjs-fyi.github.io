Thank you for the information.  How many servers do you monitor with zabbix?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

We&#039;re using zabbix + puppet fro tribily.com and are overall very happy with it. 

One gotcha that will save you a lot fo time is that it is currently impossible (in any proper way) to install zabbix server from a puppet recipe on debian lenny using backports. 
It&#039;s a combination of the zabbix server package doing some nasties with dbconfig-common and the way preseeding works which is actually broken.

Other then that, highly recommended. For Puppet, there&#039;s foreman as a web interface, which is supposedly more advanced then the puppet dashboard. We haven&#039;t tried either of them so far, so I can give you no opinion. 

If you need more info, #zabbix on freenode and # puppet on the same are very good places to get info. You can also email me directly if you have specific questions. I can possibly give you some of our puppet recipes also. We are looking to opensource them soon, but currently they have too much private information in them :)

cheers,

Walter]]></description>

Thanks for the information!  I&#039;m not (yet) active in the Zabbix community -- any ETA on 2.0?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/12/linux-management-and-monitoring-zabbix-puppet/#comment-6&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;.

a wild guess would be the second quarter of this  year :)
although individual features will be available in alpha builds before that, just like some already are in just released 1.9.1]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi. first, a minor typo - &quot;I&#039;ve sent a good part of this week&quot;.

second, yeah, you can use api to populate inventory data. also, there might be automated inventory data gathering available in zabbix 2.0, unless you need the functionality right now.]]></description>
