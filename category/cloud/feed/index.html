										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Admittedly, the world of file services has changed since Novell ruled the roost with Netware.  All sorts of new buzzwords exist: Web Content Management, Enterprise Document Management, Document Archiving, Knowledge Management &#8230; but you still can&#8217;t beat simple file storage service like Windows offers natively.  Except, it is really hard to provide that kind of service at a very large scale.<br />
So here is the question &#8212; how do I provide a file service with the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must scale beyond 25,000 users (potentially 100,000), each with private &#8220;home&#8221; directories, plus whatever permutations of group space can be imagined.</li>
<li>Must support large amounts of storage, including individual files of several hundred gigabytes, user/group quotas of several terabytes.</li>
<li>Must support access from OSX, Windows, and Linux such that applications on these systems can natively open, read, write files &#8212; in other words, similar to simple CIFS access, though a non-native client to support this functionality is acceptable.</li>
<li>Must support some level of access from mobile devices, including Android, iPhone/iPad, Windows Mobile, and ideally Blackberry too.</li>
<li>Must provide a rich &#8220;sexy-looking&#8221; web interface.</li>
<li>Must provide consistent abstract interface &#8212; in other words, scaling across hundreds of servers is acceptable, as long as users never need to be told &#8220;connect to server #17 for X, and server #53 for Y&#8221;.  There should be some sort of abstracted virtual filesystem.</li>
<li>Must support user-controllable ACLs to facilitate sharing and security.</li>
<li>Must be accessible by non-technical end users with very little handholding &#8211; should be &#8220;intuitive&#8221;.</li>
<li>Must allow integration with backup solution that can provide file-level restoration.</li>
<li>Should allow for storage of data to be accessed by Linux and Windows servers, such as user generated web content, HPC-generated research data, etc.</li>
<li>Should allow for attachment of metadata for searching.</li>
<li>Should allow integration with backup solution that allows end-user to perform file-level restoration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some have tried to convince me that Windows DFS can do all this, but I have yet to see a deployment that actually encompasses all of the above.  Anyone have any references?</p>
<p>I am quite intrigued by <a href="http://openafs.org/">OpenAFS</a>, using the <a href="http://www.filedrawers.org/">filedrawers</a> web interface, and possibly using the Samba gateway to avoid deploying the OpenAFS client to every machine &#8212; anyone with any experience doing this?  Anyone serve OpenAFS data out over DAV via Apache, mod_dav, and mod_waklog?  Is filedrawers or DAV an acceptable mobile device access mechanism?  Pitfalls?</p>
<p>What else should I be considering?</p>
